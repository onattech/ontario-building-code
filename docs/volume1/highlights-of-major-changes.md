# Highlights of Major Changes in 2012 Code

## Resource Conservation

This edition of the Building Code promotes resource conservation through building design and construction by:

-   Expanding the use of treated rainwater, greywater and non-potable water including permitting storm sewage or
    greywater to be used as a water supply for flushing of water closets or urinals, subsurface irrigation and priming of traps.
-   Permitting treated rainwater to be used as a water supply for clothes washers, laundry trays, mop sinks, bedpan washers,
    flushing of water closets and urinals, hose bibbs, subsurface irrigation and priming of traps.
-   Requiring newly installed water closets in Group C occupancies to be 4.8 L per flush (LPF) or less. Where a 4.1/6.0 LPF
    dual flush water closet is installed, it is deemed to meet this requirement.
-   Requiring newly installed urinals to meet 1.9 litres per flush requirements in all occupancies.
-   Requiring high efficiency shower heads (7.6 litres per minute) in residential occupancies.
-   Permitting the installation of drainless composting toilets in all areas, including those with municipal services.
-   Requiring that large buildings for which building permits are applied, on or after January 1, 2017, meet either:
-   an energy efficiency level that is 13% higher than levels required in 2012 and up until December 31, 2016, or
-   conformance to Division 1 and Division 3 or 5 of MMAH Supplementary Standard SB-10 “Energy Efficiency
    Requirements”. (These new provisions also address requirements for carbon dioxide equivalents and peak
    electric demand.)
-   Requiring that houses for which building permits are applied, on or after January 1, 2017, meet either:
    -   an energy efficiency level that is 15% higher than the level required in 2012 and up until December 31, 2016, or
    -   conformance to Chapters 1 and 3 of MMAH Supplementary Standard SB-12 “Energy Efficiency for Housing”
        that sets out alternate compliance paths for meeting a performance level that is equal to a rating of 80 or more
        when evaluated in accordance with NRCan, “EnerGuide for New Houses”.
-   This edition of the Code also implements other incremental energy-conserving changes including requirements to
    provide programmable thermostats, and to equip all gas-fired furnaces installed in “Part 9" dwellings with electronically
    commutated motors.

## Fire Safety

New definitions for ‘fire stop’ and ‘fire block’ are added.
Permit smoke detectors that sound a localized in-suite alarm to be installed in dwelling units of multi-unit residential
buildings.
Require a smoke alarm in all sleeping rooms within dwelling units.
Require a hard-wired smoke alarms to have a 7-day battery-back-up power supply to ensure continued protection during
extended power outages.
Require exits signs to use the ISO standard symbol using the green “running man” with an arrow sign. This replaces the
traditional exit sign requirements such as “EXIT” and “EXIT/SORTIE” in red lettering on a contrasting background.
Environmental Separation/Building Envelope
Changes include the following:
• Earthquake loads need not be considered in the design of building envelope components for buildings other than post-
disaster buildings.
• Require building components to be selected based on exposure and climactic conditions.
• Require seismic effects to be considered in the design for environmental separations in post-disaster buildings.
• Prescriptive requirements for shakes and shingles have been deleted.
• Reference to the AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440, “NAFS - North American Fenestration Standard/Specification
for Windows, Doors, and Skylights”. This replaces the previous CAN/CSA-A440.0, “Windows” standard.
• New provisions related to the performance of fenestration have been added.
