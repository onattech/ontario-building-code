# Preface

## Introduction

The Building Code is a regulation made under the Building Code Act, 1992. This edition of the Building Code Compendium
contains the Supplementary Standards referenced by the Code and additional explanatory material and is prepared for
purposes of convenience only. For the authoritative text of the Building Code regulation, see the official volumes. The 2012 Building Code was enacted by Ontario Regulation 332/12, which came into force on January 1, 2014.

The Building Code sets out technical requirements for the construction (including renovation) and demolition of buildings, the change of use of existing buildings where the change would result in an increase in hazard and the maintenance and operation of on-site sewage systems. The technical requirements of the Building Code do not have application to existing buildings other than the maintenance and operation of on-site sewage systems and buildings which undergo a change of use where the change would result in an increase in hazard.

The Code is essentially a set of minimum provisions respecting the safety of buildings with reference to public health, fire protection, accessibility and structural sufficiency. It is not intended to be a textbook on building design, advice on which should be sought from professional sources. Its primary purpose is the promotion of public safety through the application of appropriate uniform building standards.

The 2012 Building Code updated the previous edition of the Building Code, which dated from 2006. Many of the changes
introduced into the 2012 Building Code increased the level of harmonization between Ontario’s Code and those in other
Canadian jurisdictions. As well, the 2012 Building Code is written in an objective-based format which is intended to
promote innovation and flexibility in design and construction.

## The Building Code and the Model National Construction Codes

The Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes (CCBFC), supported by the National Research Council (NRC),
released new editions of the model National Building, Plumbing and Fire Codes (mNBC, mNPC and mNFC) in 2010. These
Codes have no legal status unless adopted by a province, territory or municipality.

Ontario’s 2012 Building Code applies throughout Ontario and is based in large measure on the 2010 mNBC and mNPC. The
amendments to the Building Code filed in May 2019 introduce further changes that harmonize with the 2015 mNBC and
mNPC. However, differences between the model National Codes and Ontario’s Building Code occur. Ontario’s 2012
Building Code has Ontario-specific requirements in areas such as energy efficiency, water conservation, renovation of
existing buildings, and barrier-free access. Ontario has also moved to consolidate construction requirements from other
legislation into the Building Code, including those related to on-site sewage systems, pools, spas, food premises, private sewers and private water supplies.

## Objective-Based Code Format

The 2012 Building Code is Ontario’s second edition of the Building Code published in an objective-based format. The
objective-based format augments specific technical requirements by identifying the underlying objectives and sub-objectives of those requirements (see table below). Each technical requirement that is an acceptable solution in Division B is linked to one or more of the objectives, as well as functional statements, through the Attribution Tables in Supplementary Standard SA-1. Some objectives were developed jointly by the NRC and Canadian provincial/territorial jurisdictions.

#### Functional Statements

Functional Statements describe what the design and construction of the building must do to achieve the objectives. At
least one functional statement is linked to each technical requirement that is an acceptable solution in Division B.

## Structure of the Objective-Based Code

The Building Code is divided into three Divisions, which are further subdivided into Parts.

## Division A Compliance, Objectives and Functional Statements

#### Part 1 Compliance and General

-   Organization and application
-   Compliance
-   Interpretation
-   Defined terms, symbols and abbreviations
-   List of applicable law for the purposes of obtaining a permit under Sections 8 and 10 of the Act

#### Part 2 Objectives

#### Part 3 Functional Statements

## Division B Acceptable Solutions

#### Part 1 General

Part 1 contains the compliance and general requirements of the code, including organization, application,
interpretation, terms and abbreviations, and referenced documents and organization.

#### Part 2 Reserved

Part 2 is reserved to maintain the organization of the acceptable solutions in a manner similar to previous Codes and to accommodate potential future changes in this Code and the model National Building Code (mNBC).

#### Part 3 Fire Protection, Occupant Safety and Accessibility

Part 3 contains the requirements with respect to health and fire safety, which depend upon the use to which a building is put and its type of occupancy. The first Section contains material relating to occupancy classification and the more occupancy and fire safety within floor areas, exit requirements, requirements for service spaces and health requirements. Section 3.8. contains requirements for those buildings required to be accessible to persons with physical or sensory disabilities. Section 3.11. includes requirements for the design of public pools.

#### Part 4 Structural Design

Part 4 is made up of four Sections. The first deals with the loads to be used in design calculations and the methods of design to be followed. Section 4.2. regulates foundation design and construction. Section 4.3. deals with design in wood, masonry, concrete, steel, aluminum and glass. Section 4.4. deals with the design of air-supported structures, parking structures and guards over retaining walls. Section 4.3. and parts of Section 4.4. contain performance requirements referring to the design methods outlined in detail in the relevant Canadian Standards.

## Additional Information

### Metric Conversion

For the most part, the official units of measurement in the Code are based on the metric system. However, imperial
equivalent values which appear in brackets in Part 9 are included for convenience only.

Furthermore, Part 7 has been converted to SI units where it is feasible, except for pipe sizes which are expressed in inches.These are nominal dimensions by which pipe is known in the trade and the exact dimension may vary with different pipe materials.

### Numbering System

A decimal numbering system has been used to identify particular requirements. The first number indicates the Part of the Code, the second, the Section in the Part, the third, the Subsection and the fourth, the Article in the Subsection. An Article may be further broken down into Sentences (indicated by numbers in brackets), and the Sentence further divided into Clauses and Subclauses. These are illustrated as follows:

3.6.2.
